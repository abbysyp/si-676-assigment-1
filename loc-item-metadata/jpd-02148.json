During the Tenmei (1781-89) and Kansei (1789-1801) periods, many sumptuously detailed color-printed picture books were published in Japan. They used advanced and time-consuming printing techniques, such as kirazuri (application of metallic pigments and mica), karazuri (blind-printing), and bokashi (graduation of color). This book is considered to be the finest example of such books. It consists of two pictures of the Chinese man from Nanking who supplied the rare birds from which the illustrations were made, and ten pictures that combine birds and plants in skillful compositions. This version in the National Diet Library is missing one picture of the Chinese supplier, the introduction, explanatory notes, and the colophon. Many picture books depicting plants and animals were made during the Edo period, the result of a concurrence of the deepening of honzo\u0304gaku (traditional pharmacognosy--the knowledge of medical substances of biological origin, particularly from plants) from China and the arrival of knowledge of Western natural history from Holland.

Each double page of the book contains a painted illustration of a plant and two species of insects, along with two kyo\u0304ka (a poem style originating from waka, literally, Japanese poems). The kyo\u0304ka are ostensibly insect-themed love poems. In all, 15 colored wood-block prints are included.

The work consists of five sections in five chapters. The original title slip on which the book title and the volume title were printed is attached to the center of the front cover.

It contains 72 kyo\u0304ka (humorous and satirical Japanese poems of 31 syllables) written about the moon and five pictures painted by the ukiyo-e artist Kitagawa Utamaro (circa 1753--1806). The title Kyo\u0304getsubo\u0304 (The moon-mad monk, or crazy gazing at the moon) means a man driven mad by the moon, but it is said to be a reference to the poet Gyo\u0304getsubo\u0304 (Reizei Tamemori 1265-1328), who is considered the founder of the line of kyo\u0304ka poets. Ki no Sadamaru (1760--1841) selected the poems and wrote the preface. The pictures all show the moon. The first picture, Akashi, is a scene from Genji Monogatari (The tale of Genji) and depicts Lord Genji looking at the moon from Akashi Bay. The second picture depicts a woodcutter gazing at the moon from the top of a bridge in the ink painting style. The third picture shows tsukimi (moon-viewing) in Yoshiwara. The fourth picture shows the moon peeking out from the side of a mountain while a farming family works in the foreground. The fifth picture shows a palace in the moon. The order of the pictures varies according to the copy of the book. As Utamaro also painted pictures for two other books called Ginsekai (The silver world, about snow) and Fugen-zo (Statue of Fugen, about flowers), this book is considered to be part of a trilogy involving snow, the moon, and flowers.
