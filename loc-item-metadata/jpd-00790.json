They used advanced and time-consuming printing techniques, such as kirazuri (application of metallic pigments and mica), karazuri (blind-printing), and bokashi (graduation of color). This book is considered to be the finest example of such books. It consists of two pictures of the Chinese man from Nanking who supplied the rare birds from which the illustrations were made, and ten pictures that combine birds and plants in skillful compositions. This version in the National Diet Library is missing one picture of the Chinese supplier, the introduction, explanatory notes, and the colophon. Many picture books depicting plants and animals were made during the Edo period, the result of a concurrence of the deepening of honzo\u0304gaku (traditional pharmacognosy--the knowledge of medical substances of biological origin, particularly from plants) from China and the arrival of knowledge of Western natural history from Holland. This work was intended not only to be enjoyed as a beautiful picture book; it also is thought to have fulfilled the role, as a document that accurately depicted rare birds, of satisfying the growing popular interest in natural history."], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2021-07-23T21:23:39.166Z", "group": ["wdlpartner", "catalog-split-04", "catalog", "world-digital-library-partners", "main-catalog-split-04", "main-catalog"], "hassegments": true, "id": "http://www.loc.gov/item/2021666490/", "image_url": ["https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:17:82:8:wdl_17828:0015/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:17:82:8:wdl_17828:0015/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg#h=285&w=416", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:17:82:8:wdl_17828:0015/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg#h=571&w=833", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:17:82:8:wdl_17828:0015/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg#h=1143&w=1666", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:17:82:8:wdl_17828:0015/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg#h=2287&w=3332", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:17:82:8:wdl_17828:0015/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg#h=4574&w=6664"], "index": 2, "language": ["japanese"], "location": ["japan"], "mime_type": ["application/zip", "application/pdf", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["2021666490", "2021-05-26t13:43:12"], "online_format": ["compressed data", "pdf", "image"], "original_format": ["book"], "partof": ["catalog", "national diet library", "world digital library - partner items", "world digital library"], "score": 20.020327, "shelf_id": "http://lccn.loc.gov/2021666490", "site": ["catalog"], "subject": ["japan", "ukiyo-e", "edo period", "woodcuts", "birds", "plants", "flowers", "block printing"], "timestamp": "2022-09-11T21:10:14.463Z", "title": "Pictures of Imported Birds.", "type": ["text"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/2021666490/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/2021666427/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/wdl.11850/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_11850/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2021666427", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.11850", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_11850_001/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_11850_002/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_11850_003/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_11850_004/", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_11850_005/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["suzuki, harunobu"], "date": "1770-01-01", "dates": ["1770"], "description": ["Seiro\u0304 Bijin Awase (Beauties of Yoshiwara) is one of the finest multicolored woodblock printed books in Japan. It was published in 1770. The book depicts 166 courtesans of the Yoshiwara, the pleasure quarter in Edo (present-day Tokyo), with the names of the courtesans and the brothels where they worked, with a haiku (a short poem) in the background of each illustration. The work consists of five sections in five chapters. The original title slip on which the book title and the volume title were printed is attached to the center of the front cover. Each chapter is compiled according to the subject of the haiku: volume 1 for sakura (cherry blossoms), volume 2 for hototogisu (little cuckoo), volume 3 for tsuki (the moon), volume 4 for momiji (the beautifully tinted autumn leaves), and volume 5 for yuki (snow). At the end of volume 5 is the colophon, which shows the publication date, the publisher's name, and the engraver's name. Although the designer's name is not directly mentioned, Suzuki Harunobu (circa 1725-70) is mentioned in the preface and is thought to have designed the illustrations. Harunobu was a leading ukiyo-e artist in the Meiwa era (1764-71) of the Edo period, known for his skill in depicting beautiful young women. In addition to his paintings, he produced a number of works of printed art and is said to have been the pioneer of nishiki-e (multicolored woodblock prints of ukiyo-e)."], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2021-07-23T21:12:05.283Z", "group": ["wdlpartner", "catalog-split-04", "catalog", "world-digital-library-partners", "main-catalog-split-04", "main-catalog"], "hassegments": true, "id": "http://www.loc.gov/item/2021666427/", "image_url": ["https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:11:85:0_:00:1:wdl_11850_001:1286776_R0000014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:11:85:0_:00:1:wdl_11850_001:1286776_R0000014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg#h=205&w=263", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:11:85:0_:00:1:wdl_11850_001:1286776_R0000014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg#h=410&w=526", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:11:85:0_:00:1:wdl_11850_001:1286776_R0000014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg#h=820&w=1053", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:11:85:0_:00:1:wdl_11850_001:1286776_R0000014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg#h=1641&w=2107", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:11:85:0_:00:1:wdl_11850_001:1286776_R0000014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg#h=3282&w=4214"], "index": 3, "language": ["japanese"], "location": ["japan", "tokyo"], "mime_type": ["application/zip", "application/pdf", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["2021-05-26t11:49:35", "2021666427"], "online_format": ["compressed data", "pdf", "image"], "original_format": ["book"], "partof": ["catalog", "national diet library", "world digital library - partner items", "world digital library"], "score": 18.535746, "shelf_id": "http://lccn.loc.gov/2021666427", "site": ["catalog"], "subject": ["japan", "feminine beauty (aesthetics)", "japanese poetry", "ukiyo-e", "women", "poetry", "brothels", "portraits", "tokyo", "clothing and dress", "block printing", "courtesans"], "timestamp": "2022-09-11T21:08:21.977Z", "title": "Beauties of Yoshiwara.", "type": ["text"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/2021666427/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["https://www.loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=2ea96b5ec90e4378a363c01d10131192", "https://loc.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/2ea96b5ec90e4378a363c01d10131192?f=json"], "campaigns": [], "date": "2021-03-22", "dates": ["2021-03-22T12:54:17Z"], "description": ["This story map explores the use of color in Japanese woodblock prints through their history and legacy, the collaborative system of color printmaking, and the sources for the dyes and pigments."], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2024-03-01T20:11:33.657Z", "group": ["geospatial_applications", "geospatial-applications"], "hassegments": false, "id": "https://www.loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=2ea96b5ec90e4378a363c01d10131192", "image_url": ["https://loc.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/2ea96b5ec90e4378a363c01d10131192/info/thumbnail/thumbnail.png"], "index": 4, "original_format": ["web page"], "partof": ["conservation division", "geospatial applications", "story maps", "preservation directorate"], "score": 14.112616, "shelf_id": "https://www.loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=2ea96b5ec90e4378a363c01d10131192", "subject": ["benizuri-e", "edo period", "woodblock", "feudal japan", "conservation", "safflower", "ukiyo-e", "nineteenth century", "metallics", "printmaking", "dyes", "history", "pigments", "prints", "sosaku-hanga", "dayflower", "sappanwood", "landscapes", "surimono", "eighteenth century", "seventeenth century", "colorants", "prussian blue", "meiji period", "nishiki-e", "orpiment", "japanese", "mica", "aizuri-e", "indigo", "hand-colored", "sumizuri-e", "floating world"], "timestamp": "2024-03-01T20:12:09.320Z", "title": "The Colorful World of Ukiyo-e", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/ghe/cascade/index.html?appid=2ea96b5ec90e4378a363c01d10131192"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://lccn.loc.gov/2011528843", "http://www.bk1.jp/trcno/11003658/?partnerid=oclc&siteid=oclc", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2011528843/"], "campaigns": [], "date": "2011", "dates": ["2011"], "description": ["Entry words also in English.
