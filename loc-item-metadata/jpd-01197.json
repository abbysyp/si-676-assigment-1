The plant took root on Japanese soil and by the Edo period (1600-1868) several hundred different types of chrysanthemum were being cultivated in the country. Gakiku is the first picture book of chrysanthemums published in Japan. Its beautiful illustrations and Chinese-style poems introduced readers to 100 different varieties of the flower. The text and lines are printed in black from woodblocks; the illustrations are hand painted in yellow, white, red, purple, and other colors. The book contains a preface, written in 1519 by Eikin (1447-1537), a priest of the Rinzai Zen sect, which states that the illustrations were the work of Junpo (1504-49), the second son of a feudal lord of that time.

The pictures were painted by the Ukiyo-e artist Kitao Masayoshi (Kuwagata Keisai, 1764-1824). The book was published in 1790. During the Tenmei (1781-89) and Kansei (1789-1801) periods, many sumptuously detailed color-printed picture books were published in Japan. They used advanced and time-consuming printing techniques, such as kirazuri (application of metallic pigments and mica), karazuri (blind-printing), and bokashi (graduation of color). This book is considered to be the finest example of such books. It consists of two pictures of the Chinese man from Nanking who supplied the rare birds from which the illustrations were made, and ten pictures that combine birds and plants in skillful compositions. This version in the National Diet Library is missing one picture of the Chinese supplier, the introduction, explanatory notes, and the colophon. Many picture books depicting plants and animals were made during the Edo period, the result of a concurrence of the deepening of honzo\u0304gaku (traditional pharmacognosy--the knowledge of medical substances of biological origin, particularly from plants) from China and the arrival of knowledge of Western natural history from Holland.
