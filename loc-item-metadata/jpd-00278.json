The pictures were painted by the Ukiyo-e artist Kitao Masayoshi (Kuwagata Keisai, 1764-1824). The book was published in 1790. During the Tenmei (1781-89) and Kansei (1789-1801) periods, many sumptuously detailed color-printed picture books were published in Japan. They used advanced and time-consuming printing techniques, such as kirazuri (application of metallic pigments and mica), karazuri (blind-printing), and bokashi (graduation of color). This book is considered to be the finest example of such books. It consists of two pictures of the Chinese man from Nanking who supplied the rare birds from which the illustrations were made, and ten pictures that combine birds and plants in skillful compositions. This version in the National Diet Library is missing one picture of the Chinese supplier, the introduction, explanatory notes, and the colophon. Many picture books depicting plants and animals were made during the Edo period, the result of a concurrence of the deepening of honzo\u0304gaku (traditional pharmacognosy--the knowledge of medical substances of biological origin, particularly from plants) from China and the arrival of knowledge of Western natural history from Holland.

The old man who is kneeling, brush in hand, about to paint, is Hokusai. Oei is sitting beside him holding a kiseru (an oriental smoking pipe with a long straight shank and a small bowl) and gazing at her father. Oei was also an ukiyo-e artist who painted under the artist name of Katsushika Oi. The picture is accompanied by text describing their lives together. The narrative informs us that Hokusai never left his kotatsu (low, covered table with a heat source underneath) from autumn to early summer. He painted and slept there, even meeting people while ensconced underneath the table as rubbish piled up in a corner of the room. From the address given in the text, it can be assumed that it depicts Hokusai in the late 1840s. The author, Tsuyuki Iitsu (died circa 1893), was one of Hokusai's disciples and inherited Iitsu, one of Hokusai's artist names, from him.
