These included the dissemination of information about emigration through subsidies to a private emigration company (assumed to be the Overseas Development Company, established in 1916); the provision of educational and sanitary facilities in overseas destinations; discussions about industrial law; and financial assistance for travel by emigrants and for housing construction and living expenses. The Foreign Ministry, which was the main authority in charge of emigration, was opposed to providing financial assistance for travel expenses, as it believed that this would damage Japan's external relations without increasing the number of emigrants. It therefore decided not to fund emigrant travel expenses in 1923. In February 1924, government support for emigrants was increased to 200 yen for each person above the age of 12 years (20,000 yen for 100 people) as a temporary measure to incentivize victims of the Great Kanto Earthquake of September 1, 1923. The increase resulted in many more applicants seeking to emigrate to South America. The Overseas Development Company's business activities included emigration, reclamation, investment, and education. It dealt frequently with emigration to Brazil, and used this pamphlet to market itself and provide useful information. The document contained information about the required qualifications for emigration, details about jobs (salary and other matters), travel expenses, necessary preparations, application procedures, and financial support available for travel expenses."], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2021-07-24T02:07:13.640Z", "group": ["wdlpartner", "catalog-split-09", "catalog", "world-digital-library-partners", "main-catalog-split-09", "main-catalog"], "hassegments": true, "id": "http://www.loc.gov/item/2021667476/", "image_url": ["https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:14:46:0:wdl_14460:002/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:14:46:0:wdl_14460:002/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg#h=184&w=372", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:14:46:0:wdl_14460:002/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg#h=369&w=744", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:14:46:0:wdl_14460:002/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg#h=738&w=1489", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:gdcwdl:wd:l_:14:46:0:wdl_14460:002/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg#h=1477&w=2979"], "index": 3, "language": ["japanese"], "location": ["brazil", "japan"], "mime_type": ["application/zip", "application/pdf", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["2021-05-27t18:17:47", "2021667476"], "online_format": ["compressed data", "pdf", "image"], "original_format": ["book"], "partof": ["world digital library", "world digital library - partner items", "national diet library", "catalog"], "score": 12.601788, "shelf_id": "http://lccn.loc.gov/2021667476", "site": ["catalog"], "subject": ["japan", "brazil", "emigrants", "emigration and immigration", "japanese"], "timestamp": "2022-09-11T21:31:35.766Z", "title": "Guidance for Families on How to Emigrate to Brazil.", "type": ["text"], "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/2021667476/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.wdl/wdl.7377", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/wdl.7377/", "http://www.loc.gov/item/2021666356/", "http://lccn.loc.gov/2021666356", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcwdl.wdl_07377/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["federation of immigration associations"], "date": "1932-01-01", "dates": ["1932"], "description": ["This brochure was published by the Federation of Immigration Associations, which was supported by the Japanese government for the purpose of recruiting emigrants from Japan to other countries.
