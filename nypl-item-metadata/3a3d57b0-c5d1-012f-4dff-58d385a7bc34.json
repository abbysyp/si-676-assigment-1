A 'pien' is a signboard with the name of the donor written on one end and the name of the donee on the opposite end.  Between these are four characters that are supposed to set forth, in flowery language, the virtues of the doctor.  In this instance, a red satin scroll written in goldleaf, a duplicate of the 'pien,' was also given to the doctor who attended the family.  This scroll is supposed to be carried about by the doctor and hung up on proper occasions.  In addition to these presents the Taotai gave a cash gift to the Hospital amounting to about $75.00 United States money, two hundred eggs, several hams, chickens, cakes and other dainties.  A Chinese band and attendants carrying flags and red umbrellas accompanied the presents as they were brought through the streets.  NOTE.  Changteh is the station in Hunan, China occupied by the missionaries of the Cumberland Church, and now one of the regular stations of the Board.\"--caption accompanying the publication of the above photograph in the February 1908 issue (vol.
